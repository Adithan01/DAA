# allignment-matrix
The code takes 2 input strings of a.g.t.c protiens
and it checks if they are equal in length and the starts filling the allignment matrix.
the allignment matrix filler uses 2 functions which check if the characters are a match then checks diagnol else 
takes max of nieghbouring 3 elements.
This is all ive completed for now
ive also had errors when passing the 2d array in to the function which is causing a slightly faulty matrix.
